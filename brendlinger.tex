\title{ATLAS Higgs Physics Results}

\author{ Kurt Brendlinger, on behalf of the ATLAS Collaboration }

\address{~\\DESY, Notkestra\ss e 85,\\ 22607 Hamburg, Germany}

\maketitle\abstracts{
Recent Higgs boson results are presented using up to 140~fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data
delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS Detector.
Three measurements are discussed:
first, the cross section of a Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson is measured in phase space
regions called simplified template cross sections (STXS),
using events with the Higgs decaying to a $b\bar b$ pair.
An additional measurement of this associated Higgs production is performed in the $H{\rightarrow}WW$
decay channel.
Finally, the production of a Higgs in association iwth a $t\bar t$ pair is measured in the Higgs
diphoton decay channel. In addition, the status of searches for di-Higgs production is reviewed.

\section{Introduction}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \cite{Evans:2008zzb} has delivered about 155 fb$^{-1}$ of
collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV during its Run 2 data taking program
between 2015 and 2018.
With this data, the
ATLAS Detector \cite{PERF-2007-01} is able to probe the nature of the Higgs boson with unprecedented
precision. The following summarizes the most recent measurements of Higgs boson production using up
to 140 fb$^{-1}$ of high-quality data. These measurements are performed in the $b\bar b$,
diphoton ($\gamma\gamma$) and $WW$ (${\rightarrow}\ell\nu\ell'\nu'$) decay channels, and specifically
target Higgs production in association with a vector boson (\vh) or in assoication with a top
quark pair ($t\bar tH$).

Higgs measurements are performed in the context of the simplified template cross section
framework \cite{deFlorian:2016spz,Badger:2016bpw},
which is designed to measure cross sections of production modes as well as kinematic phase space
regions, while reducing the model dependence contained inside the measurements.

\section{Measurement of the \vh production mode in the $b\bar b$ decay channel}\label{sec:vh_bb}

The observation of Higgs boson production in association with a $W$ or $Z$ boson, reported in
\cite{HIGG-2018-04}, was achieved by combined measurements in the $H{\rightarrow}b\bar b$,
$H{\rightarrow}ZZ^*{\rightarrow}4\ell$ and $H{\rightarrow}\gamma\gamma$ decay channels using
80~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in Run~2.
Following the observation, the \vh production mode is studied in further detail using Higgs bosons
decaying to a pair of $b$-jets \cite{Aaboud:2019nan}, the most sensitive decay channel for the \vh production mode,
using the same analysis strategy and integrated luminosity.
The cross section is measured in bins of the transverse momentum of the associated vector boson,
$p^{V}_\mathrm{T}$. We do this because BLAH.

The analysis considers events with 2 $b$-tagged jets and 0, 1 or 2 reconstructed leptons consistent
with vector boson signatures. To extract the signal, eight separate boosted decision trees (BDTs)
are trained, one for each signal region considered.
The correlation between the $p^{V}_\mathrm{T}$ and the BDT output score is exploited
to extract the cross section in each truth $p^{V}_\mathrm{T}$ category.
Figure~\ref{fig:vh_bb_a} compares the BDT output of the inclusive signal as well as the two
truth categories (?) for a signal region targeting \wh production with the $W$ boson decaying to
$\ell\nu$. The clear shape differences, and their distinguishability from background, can be used to
extract both cross sections simultaneously. The use of a BDT allows for more sensitive cross section
measurements, in the simplified template scheme, than a simple fiducial cross section, because the
improved discrimination against background and between STXS regions.

Figure~\ref{fig:vh_bb_b} reports the measured cross sections in each of the measured fiducial regions
of the simplified template cross section framework. The measurements presented here are also used
to constrain parameters in an effective Lagrangian framework, such as dimension-6 operators whose
deviation from predictions would indicate interactions beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, the
simplified template cross sections measured in this analysis can be readily combined with other
decay channels, allowing each decay channel to contribute toward reaching the ultimate precision of
the full Higgs fiducial phase space.

\section{Measurement of the \vh production mode in the $WW$ decay channel} \label{sec:vh_ww}

The \vh production of Higgs bosons is also studied in the $H{\rightarrow}WW$ decay channel
 using 36.1~fb$^{-1}$ \cite{HIGG-2017-14}.

Figure~\ref{fig:ww_vh_a} depicts the fitted \wh signal and background in the 6 BDT bins.

Figure~\ref{fig:ww_vh_b} compares the measured cross section times branching ratio for $ZH$ and \wh,
compared to the SM prediction. A mild excess is seen in both cases, though the measured values are
consistent with the SM expectation.

\section{Measurement of Higgs production in association with a $t\bar t$ pair in the diphoton decay channel}\label{sec:ttH_yy}

The measurement of Higgs production with an associated $t\bar t$ pair ($ttH$ production) and decaying
to two photons has been updated to include the full Run~2 dataset \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-004},
following the same analysis strategy as described in \cite{Aaboud:2018urx}. The $ttH$ production is
divided into two categories: {\itshape hadronic} decays of the $t\bar t$ pair, and
{\itshape leptonic} decays of at least one of the top quarks. Two BDTs are developed, one
for hadronic and one for leptonic events, which give discrimination against both non-resonant
background and non-$ttH$ Higgs production. The signal is isolated in 7 regions defined by the BDTs
(with 3 BDT bins in the leptonic events and 4 BDTs in the hadronic events).

To measure the $ttH$ cross section, ...
Figure~\ref{fig:tth_a} shows the sum of she signal and background fits in all 7 categories, where
the contribution from each channel is weighted by its significance (?).

In Figure~\ref{fig:tth_b}, the contribution of $ttH$ signal, other Higgs
production processes, and continuous background is shown for each catgory.

The measured $ttH$ production cross section times branching ratio in a fiducial region requiring the
Higgs rapidity $|y_H|<2.5$ is measured to be
%
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{ttH} \times B_{\gamma\gamma} = 1.59~^{+0.38}_{-0.36} ~\textrm{(stat.)}
~^{+0.15}_{-0.12} ~\textrm{(exp.)}
~^{+0.15}_{-0.11} ~\textrm{(th.)}~\textrm{fb},
\end{equation}
%
which is 1.4 times the SM prediction.
The measurement has an observed significance of 4.9$\sigma$ (4.2$\sigma$ expected).

    (b) The number of data events in the diphoton invariant mass window containing 90\% of the expected
    $ttH$ signal, in each BDT bin of the hadronic and leptonic categories.

    production, are shown in each bin \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-004}.
